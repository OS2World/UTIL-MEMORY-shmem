This project uses the TPLIB library for some of its
userinterface functionality.

The binary for the library (TPLIB.LIB) is included in
the distribution ZIP, as well as the interface include
files (TP*.H). This is an OS/2 32-bit binary, compiled
and usable with the IBM VisualAge 3.6 C/C++ compiler.

The TPLIB library is owned and copyrighted by Fsys Software,
but use in non-commercial projects is allowed after getting
(email) permission. Contact: info@fsys.nl

TPLIB might become a commercial offering sometime in the
future, with (extended) DOS, Windows-NT and OS/2 versions.
